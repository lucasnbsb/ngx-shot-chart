# NgxShotChart üèÄ

A simple way to create shotcharts in real time with Angular and d3.js.

[Try it out in the demo app!](https://lucasnbsb.github.io/ngx-shot-chart/)

## Installation
```
npm install ngx-shot-chart d3 @types/d3
```

## Basic functionality
This lib exposes a `NgxShotChartComponent` that renders a shot chart and a `NgxShotChartService` with primitives to manipulate symbols in the chart.


## The component
- Only emmits the mutually esclusive  `ChartClicked` and `SymbolClicked` events 
- Symbols can be any [d3.symbolType](https://d3js.org/d3-shape/symbol#symbolsFill)
- Court and symbols default fill collor is the current text color
- ‚õπÔ∏è Pre-configured with NBA, FIBA and NCAA court sizes

### Usage: 
```typescript
<ngx-shot-chart league='nba' (ChartClicked)="handleChartClicked($event)" (SymbolClicked)="handleSymbolClicked($event)"></ngx-shot-chart>
```

## The service

Exposes a crud interface for shots, methods to draw and clear the court and symbols, and utilities.

### Usage:

```typescript
import { ShotChartService } from 'ngx-shot-chart';

constructor(private shotChartService: ShotChartService) {}

// Add a shot to the chart whenever it is clicked ü™£
handleChartClick(event: ChartClickedEvent) {
  this.chart.AddShot(event, d3.symbolCircle);
}

// Remove a shot from the chart whenever the symbol is clicked üóëÔ∏è
handleSymbolClick(event: SymbolClickEvent) {
  this.chart.RemoveShot(event.id);
}
```
